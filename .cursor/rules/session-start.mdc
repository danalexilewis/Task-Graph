# Session Start

At the start of every session, run:

```bash
pnpm tg status
```

This surfaces:
- Plans in progress
- Tasks stuck in `doing` (may need cleanup)
- **Active work:** doing tasks with agent_id and plan (when multiple agents are active)
- Next runnable tasks

**When multiple agents are active:** Read the "Active work" section. Avoid picking tasks that touch the same area/files as another agent's doing task. If overlap is detected, leave a `tg note` and pick a different task.

Address any stale `doing` tasks before starting new work. See **taskgraph-workflow.mdc → Recovery** for cleanup steps.
