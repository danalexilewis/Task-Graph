# Session Start

At the start of every session, run:

```bash
pnpm tg status
```

This surfaces:
- Plans in progress
- Tasks stuck in `doing` (may need cleanup)
- Next runnable tasks

Address any stale `doing` tasks before starting new work. See **taskgraph-workflow.mdc → Recovery** for cleanup steps.
