# Session Start

At the start of every session, run:

- **Orchestrator (main session):** `pnpm tg status --tasks` — full task list (Id, Title, Plan, Status, Owner). Use this so you see all active tasks, not just the 3 next runnable shown by default status.
- **Sub-agents (implementer, reviewer, etc.):** `pnpm tg status --tasks` — task list only; you don't need plans or initiatives.

```bash
# Orchestrator:
pnpm tg status --tasks

# Sub-agent (when you are executing a single task):
pnpm tg status --tasks
```

Full task list surfaces:

- All active tasks (todo, doing, blocked) with plan and owner
- **Doing tasks** show owner — use for multi-agent (avoid overlapping files with another agent's task)
- Stale `doing` or forgotten `todo` tasks to clean up (see Recovery)

**Key constraints (see AGENT.md for details):**

- Sub-agent dispatch is **mandatory** for task execution — do not do the work yourself.
- Planner-analyst dispatch is **mandatory** before writing any plan.
- Feed all runnable non-conflicting tasks; **Cursor decides** how many run in parallel.
- Plans must have parallel-ready tasks (≥2 with no blockedBy).

**When multiple agents are active:** Read the "Active work" section. Avoid picking tasks that touch the same area/files as another agent's doing task. If overlap is detected, leave a `tg note` and pick a different task.

Address any stale `doing` tasks before starting new work. See **taskgraph-workflow.mdc → Recovery** for cleanup steps.
